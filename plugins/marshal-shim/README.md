# marshal-shim plugin

Connects this Claude Code session to the [marshal](https://github.com/ignition-is-go/marshal) coordination daemon so it can see and message other live Claude sessions — on the same machine or across a network.

## Prerequisites

This plugin assumes the `marshal-shim` and `marshal-daemon` binaries are already on your `PATH`. Install them once with:

```bash
cargo install marshal-shim marshal-daemon
```

Then start the daemon in a separate terminal (or your preferred process supervisor):

```bash
marshal-daemon
```

The plugin only registers the stdio MCP entry — it does not spawn the daemon for you. Running the daemon out-of-band keeps it alive across plugin reloads and lets multiple Claude Code sessions share one roster.

## What you get

Reads are MCP **resources**; writes are MCP **tools**. Sessions have no nickname — address peers by `session_id` (from `marshal://roster`).

Resources (`resources/read`):

- `marshal://whoami` — your `{ session_id, pid, cwd, operator, host }`
- `marshal://roster` — every live session the daemon currently sees
- `marshal://rooms` — every room and its members
- `marshal://messages` — message history (`inbox`, `sent`, `unread`, `room`, `from`, `to_session`, `since`, `limit`)

Tools (`tools/call`):

- `send_message(to, body)` — send to a peer by `session_id`
- `broadcast(to_room, body)` — fan-out to every member of a room
- `join_room(room)` / `leave_room(room)` — create/join or leave an ad-hoc room
- `set_status(text)` — set the free-form `current_task` text shown on the roster
- `ack_messages(message_ids)` — mark messages read for this session

Peer messages arrive as `notifications/claude/channel` events that surface in your transcript as `<channel>` blocks. A channel block carries a bounded preview of the body; when the preview was cut, it says so and names the message to read in full from `marshal://messages`.

The plugin also ships two hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`) that run `marshal-shim claude-hook`. At session start it adds your Marshal identity to the context, and before each prompt it adds any direct message still unread as a `<marshal_inbox>` block, then marks it read. That covers what the channel didn't show, such as every message in a session started without the channels flag. (The shim reads the flag from Claude's command line, which it can't do on macOS yet; there the daemon still counts a push as shown.) A message the channel did show is already read, so it isn't repeated. Message text is escaped so it can't pose as the inbox's own framing, and a long backlog comes over several prompts rather than in one block too big for Claude to inject. If the daemon is unreachable or slow, the hooks add nothing after at most 3 seconds and the turn goes ahead.

## Optional: show the session in your status line

The `marshal-shim statusline` subcommand reads Claude Code's status payload from stdin (plus the local host and user) and renders `[user@host dir sid8]` in your footer — where `sid8` is your `session_id[:8]` — so you can tell sessions apart at a glance.

Add this block to any `settings.json` Claude Code reads — user-global (`~/.claude/settings.json` or `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json`) or project-level (`<project>/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "marshal-shim statusline"
  }
}
```

No paths, no per-OS launcher — the same block works everywhere `marshal-shim` is on `PATH`. Restart Claude Code afterwards for the change to take effect.

Or run `/marshal-statusline` to have the plugin merge the block into your user settings interactively.

## Install — plugin

```text
/plugin marketplace add ignition-is-go/marshal
/plugin install marshal-shim@marshal
```

## Install — no plugin, declarative project config

The plugin is optional. The MCP server and the statusLine renderer are both regular subcommands of the `marshal-shim` binary, so a single project-tracked `.claude/settings.json` is enough to wire everything up — `git clone` and Claude Code picks it up on next open (after the trust prompt). No marketplace, no `/plugin install`, no per-machine config edits.

Drop this at `<project>/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marshal": {
      "command": "marshal-shim",
      "env": {
        "MARSHAL_DAEMON_ADDRESS": "${MARSHAL_DAEMON_ADDRESS:-ws://localhost:6155}"
      }
    }
  },
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "marshal-shim statusline"
  },
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "marshal-shim claude-hook session-start", "timeout": 15 }] }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "marshal-shim claude-hook prompt-submit", "timeout": 15 }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `hooks` block is what the plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` does for you; leave it out and messages the live channel didn't show wait until the agent reads `marshal://messages`.

Prereq is the same as the plugin path — `cargo install marshal-shim marshal-daemon` once per machine so the binaries are on `PATH`.

## Pointing at a non-default daemon

By default the shim connects to `ws://localhost:6155`. To talk to a daemon on another host or port, set `MARSHAL_DAEMON_ADDRESS` in your shell before starting Claude Code:

```bash
export MARSHAL_DAEMON_ADDRESS=ws://my-daemon-host:6155
```

The plugin's `.mcp.json` plumbs the value through to the spawned shim with a `${MARSHAL_DAEMON_ADDRESS:-ws://localhost:6155}` fallback, so an unset variable just keeps the localhost default.

For a per-project override, drop a `.mcp.json` at your project root that pins the env block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marshal": {
      "env": { "MARSHAL_DAEMON_ADDRESS": "ws://10.0.0.5:6155" }
    }
  }
}
```

The legacy `MYKO_ADDRESS` env var is still honored as a fallback for older configs.
