//! marshal-shim — stdio MCP server backed by a MykoClient.
//!
//! On startup the shim:

//! 2. SETs a `Session` entity describing this Claude session,
//! 3. registers `on_command::<NotifyChannel>` so daemon-pushed notifications

//!    `notifications/claude/channel` MCP events,
//! 4. serves stdio MCP with a curated tool surface backed by the MykoClient.
