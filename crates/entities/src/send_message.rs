//! Server-handled `SendMessage` command.
//!
//! Persistence is primary; live push is a best-effort overlay. The pull
//! model decouples acceptance from delivery — the recipient reads on its
//! next turn via the hook, online or not. The handler:
//!   1. resolves the sender — `asSession` for connectionless HTTP-MCP
//!      callers, or the WS `client_id` for shim callers (`resolve_caller`),
//!   2. validates the recipient `Session` exists on the roster (it need
//!      NOT be online),
//!   3. persists the `Message` SET unconditionally,
//!   4. if the recipient has a live WS client, best-effort dispatches a
//!      `NotifyChannel` to surface it immediately (the Track-2 live path);
//!      otherwise the recipient pulls it next turn,
//!   5. returns separate status for the synchronous live-channel push and
//!      asynchronous wake boundary. The daemon cannot observe a later Codex
//!      bridge `turn/start`, so it never claims that wake succeeded.
//!
//! Only an unresolvable sender or unknown recipient returns a
//! `CommandError`; an offline recipient is success.
